Build system
------------

The location of the gcc source and objects should be passed as options to a
configure script rather than being hardwired into the Makefile.

Determination of the target triple should be moved from the Makefile to a
configure script.

The plugin revision is created from the subversion revision.  What if people
are using git etc?  Maybe it should be calculated in a configure script, but
since that might not get run often perhaps the Makefile is the best place.

Target subdirectories should have their own Makefiles, instead of assuming
that there's only one source file and that it's called llvm-target.cpp.

Currently the target directory (eg: i386) is calculated from the target triple
(eg: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) using gcc's config.gcc script.  This should be
done from a configure script, rather from the Makefile using the get_arch_dir
wrapper.

The Makefile needs to know the LLVM target name (eg: x86) in order to pass it
to llvm-config so as to get the libraries to link with for target codegen.
This should be calculated in a configure script (presumably by a small program
that uses the LLVM triple facilities to calculate it).  If we know this, then
we might as well rename target directories like i386/ to x86/ instead, and
eliminate use of gcc's config.gcc script.  This also means that LLVM_TARGET_NAME
could be defined from the Makefile rather than being specified in llvm-target.h.
Maybe LLVM_TARGET_INTRINSIC_PREFIX could go too.
