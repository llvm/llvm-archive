High Level Virtual Machine (HLVM)
=================================

This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for the High Level 
Virtual Machine (HLVM). HLVM is a toolkit and a set of executables to assist 
with the rapid construction of dynamic languages and their virtual machines.
It aims to foster domain specific languages, rapid compiler development, and
a common infrastructure upon which those languages can execute.

HLVM is based on LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) which endows HLVM with an
optimizing compiler, native code generation, bytecode, makefile system, and 
a basic infrastructure on which to build.

Licensing
=========
HLVM is open source software. You may freely distribute it under the terms of
the license agreements found in LICENSE.txt files, wherever they may be found
in the source tree. See the top level file, LICENSE.txt, for full details.

Documentation
=============
HLVM comes with full documentation in HTML format. These are provided in the
docs directory. Please open <hlvm>/docs/index.html to get an index of the
documentation that is available. You will find conceptual guides as well as
build and installation instructions there.
