<h2><a name="what">What is this?</a></h2>
<div class="text">
<p>This document is a "TODO" list for HLVM.  Each project in this document is 
something that would be useful for HLVM to have, and would also be a great way 
to get familiar with the system.  Some of these projects are small and 
self-contained, which may be implemented in a couple of days. Others are 
larger.  In any case, we welcome all contributions.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about tackling one of these projects, please send a mail
to the <a href="http://hlvm.org/hlvm-dev.shtml">HLVM Developer's</a> mailing 
list, so that we know the project is being worked on.  Additionally this is a 
good way to get more information about a specific project or to suggest other 
projects to add to this page.</p>

<h2><a name="code">Coding Projects</a></h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>Projects in the list below are related to working on software code</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>RNG->XHTML XSLT Stylesheet</em>. We will use the Relax/NG grammar
    for the XML version of the AST to document the AST. However, the Relax/NG
    specification is not particularly user friendly. What we need is a way to
    publish (in XHTML) the specification with descriptive documentation. A
    fairly straightforward XSLT stylsheet to translate Relax/NG to XHTML should
    do nicely. This is a nice self-contained project for someone who knows
    XSLT and can understand Relax/NG.</li>
    <li><em>APR Abstractions</em>. The runtime portion of HLVM will use APR
    as its portability layer. However, APR is written in C and not particularly
    object-oriented. We need some of the things APR supports to be wrapped in
    simple C++ classes that take care of the book keeping such as deleting APR
    objects at the right time.  Abstracts we need to wrap, currently, are Pool
    and File. These should go in HLVM's "base" library.</li>
    <li><em>Code Generation</em>. If you know or would like to learn LLVM,
    we could use help with conversion of HLVM's AST into LLVM's IR. </li>
    <li><em>Yaml Reader/Writer</em>. We intend to support a reader and
    writer of the AST in Yaml syntax. Some people just don't like XML and having
    an alternate way to build the AST from a nicer-to-read source would be
    useful in helping some people comprehend HLVM. The design should be very
    similar to the XML Reader/Writer and be based on the Syck library.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2><a name="doc">Documentation Projects</a></h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>Projects in the list below are related to working on the projects
  documentation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>API Documentation</em>. Documenting the HLVM AST API is very
    important. Currently it needs some work. Someone who knows Doxygen and 
    would like to keep the documentation up to date would be very helpful.</li>
    <li><em>Tool Documentation</em>. As HLVM produces tools, those tools need to
    be documented in a POD file. Also, the packaging of the generated HTML and
    INFO files leaves a little to be desired. In particular these file should be
    available through the public web site</li>
    <li><em>General Documentation</em>. General documentation about HLVM needs
    to be written.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2><a name="test">Testing Projects</a></h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>Projects in the list below are related to testing software.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>AST Construction Tests</em>. In order to explore and test the AST 
    node construction, we need to develop test cases that exercise these 
    aspects of HLVM. These test cases are in the <tt>tests/xml2xml</tt>
    directory.  They are snippets of XML to test construction of the
    AST by using the hlvm-xml2xml program. Many of these test cases will
    explore ideas for what should or shouldn't be in the AST.</li>
    <li><em>Code Gen Tests</em>. In order to verify program correctness, a wide
    variety of tests to check for correct code generation are needed. These test
    are found in the <tt>tests/return0</tt> directory.  These are full HLVM 
    programs written in the AST XML language that should return from main with 
    a value of 0 if the test succeeds. They are intended to check control flow,
    arithmetic, and other aspects of runtime behavior of the HLVM code 
    generator and runtime system.</li>
    <li><em>Negative Tests</em>. These are tests that provide invalid input to
    HLVM to ensure that it doesn't crash but instead generates a nice error
    message. There are no tests in this class yet. Help!</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2><a name="misc">Miscellaneous Projects</a></h2>
<div class="text">
  <p>Here are some other things that need to get done.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add HLVM project to SourceForge.net</li>
    <li>Add HLVM project to collab.net</li>
    <li>Create a logo for the project</li>
  </ol>
