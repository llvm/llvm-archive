Step 0: Build and install llvm
------------------------------

I'm assuming anyone reading this knows how to build and install llvm.
You need the latest llvm from the subversion repository.

Step 1: Build gcc
-----------------

Check out gcc from the gcc subversion repository:
  svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk SomeLocalDir
Apply the patches in the gcc-patches subdirectory, if any.  Hopefully one day
the plugin will work with an unpatched gcc, but for the moment a few small
patches need to be applied.  Configure gcc with your favorite options.
Build gcc, and install it somewhere.

Darwin special: the gcc configure script thinks darwin doesn't support dynamic
libraries and concludes that plugins won't work.  Delete or improve the check.
If you improve it, please send your patch to the gcc developers!

Step 2: Build the plugin
------------------------

In the Makefile, set the GCCSOURCE_DIR variable to point to the place you
checked out the gcc repository, rather than to where I checked it out.
Set the GCCOBJECT_DIR to point to the place you built the repository.
Admire the awfulness of the build system, and make a mental note to rewrite
it properly.

Build the plugin using "make".  The end result of the build is a shared
library, llvm.so.

Darwin special: "-shared" doesn't result in a correct dynamic library on darwin,
use "-Wl,-flat_namespace -Wl,-undefined -Wl,suppress -dynamiclib" instead.

----------------------
- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -
----------------------

Run gcc as usual, but pass -fplugin=./llvm.so as an extra command line argument.
Make sure you use the gcc you installed above, not the system gcc!

Currently the plugin isn't capable of compiling much - you have been warned.

The plugin accepts a few command line arguments, for example
-fplugin-arg-llvm-enable-gcc-optzns
Search for the comment "Process any plugin arguments" in llvm-backend.cpp,
the argument parsing code is just after this.
